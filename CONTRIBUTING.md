# Contributing to Spread

We'd love to see your contributions to Spread. There are many ways community members can contribute to the project:

* **Pull Requests:** Spread is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. The workflow for pull requests is as follows:
	* Fork the repository on Github
	* Create a topic branch
	* Make commits with singular, logical units
	* Push your changes to a topic brank in the fork of the repository
	* Submit a pull request to redspread/spread
	* Your pull request must receive a LGTM from either @ethernetdan or @mfburnett

* **Issues:** Report bugs and introduce discussion for new features under Issues. If you haven't already, it's worth going through <a href="http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/">Elika Etemad's guide</a> for good bug reporting. In one sentence, good bug reports should be both *reproducible* and *specific*. 

* **Examples:** We'd love to see more example applications built out with Spread's suggested directory structure.
